GTFS mirroring tool.  This allows us to keep the GTFS data from Adelaide
Metro into a revision control system (so we could look up historical
data).

It should be trivial to adapt this to monitor another public transit
system.

This is best used in a weekly crontab on Sunday mornings.  You shouldn't
need to run this script yourself though, I already provide a repository
at <https://github.com/micolous/adelaidemetro-gtfs>
