GTFS mirroring tool.  This allows us to keep the GTFS data from Adelaide
Metro into a revision control system (so we could look up historical
data).

It should be trivial to adapt this to monitor another public transit
system.

This is best used in a weekly crontab on Sunday mornings.

You shouldn't need to run this script yourself though, I already provide a
repository at <https://github.com/micolous/adelaidemetro-gtfs>.  It has data
starting from January 2011.  Adelaide Metro started providing this data
publicly in November 2010.
