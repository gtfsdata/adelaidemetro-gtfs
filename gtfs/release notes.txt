2) Blackwood High School stops have been renamed and services tweaked. Afternoon trips that service Blackwood High School will service the "pick up" stop, while morning trips service the "set down" stop.
3) We have added stop addresses to the "stop_desc" field in stops.txt. These will match what is displayed on the Adelaide Metro website stop pages. The addresses are meant as a guide only.
