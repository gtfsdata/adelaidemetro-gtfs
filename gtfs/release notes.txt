The following is a list of changes and upcoming events:


Upcoming Public Holidays:


Labour Day - October 1


General Amendments:


1) Due to signalling issues the tram extension on North Tce has been delayed. Please see www.adelaidemetro.com.au for further information.

In our GTFS we have changed the new tram routes (GLNELG, BTANIC, FESTVL) to commence service from August 12, but this is not a confirmed date and may change in the coming weeks. The old "Tram" route will continue to be used until further notice.

2) Implemented tram timetables for AFL Rounds 20 and 21.

3) Route W90 and W91 no longer utilise Stop 6 Leader St as a timepoint stop when traveling South towards Marion Centre Interchange and St Marys. Slight time adjustments will be present in all relevant trips.
